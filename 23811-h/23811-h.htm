<h1>THE<br />
GOOD SHIP &ldquo;ROVER.&rdquo;</h1>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">t. nelson and

London, Edinburgh, and New York.</p>
<h2>I.&nbsp; HIGH AND DRY.</h2>
<p>A gallant ship, some three feet in length, with full equipment
of white sails and sturdy masts, rigging, pennon, and figurehead;
but it had never seen the sea&mdash;never!&nbsp; It had
&ldquo;cast anchor&rdquo; nearly a year before my story begins in
the Leslies&rsquo; nursery&mdash;a very pleasant, airy room, with
nice pictures on the wall and a good many toys scattered about,
but certainly not the very least resembling the sea.&nbsp; In
fact, I don&rsquo;t think Mrs. Leslie would have liked if it had
resembled it; for she was very much afraid of the children being
near a lake or a pond <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>even, on account of the dangers of
damp feet and catching cold&mdash;two evils which always haunted
her mind more or less.&nbsp; She was rather a delicate creature,
often ailing,&mdash;which, perhaps, was the reason of these
nervous fancies; and most of the children resembled their mother
in this, that there was sure to be something the matter with one
or other of them most days of the week.&nbsp; The doctor was
seldom long out of the house.&nbsp; Fortunately, Dr. Hammond
lived just next door, so he was easily sent for; and Walter
Hammond, the doctor&rsquo;s eldest boy, was Harry Leslie&rsquo;s
dearest and most intimate friend.&nbsp; The two boys were about
eight years old, went to the same school, spent most of their
play-hours together, and intended both to go to the sea together
when they were old enough.&nbsp; For Harry Leslie, though he had
never once seen the sea any more than his ship had <!-- page
9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>done,
had heard and read a great deal about sailor life and adventures,
and had inspired Walter with the same admiration for these as he
himself felt.&nbsp; Besides, his uncle Jack, Mr. Leslie&rsquo;s
brother, who had made the ship for his little nephew, had often
told him stories about the sea which he treasured in his heart
all the more, perhaps, because he was so often mured up by his
nursery walls, or even in his little iron bed, on account of
colds, coughs, measles, chicken-pox, etc.</p>
<p>Walter Hammond, unlike his friend, was a strong, bright, merry
little fellow, never a day in the house or away from school; but
he was very fond of Harry all the same.&nbsp; Walter had only two
sisters and then a baby-brother, all of whom were rather young
for him to play with, so he spent a great deal of his leisure
time in the Leslies&rsquo; nursery.&nbsp; What scores of times
had Harry <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>and Walter studied and examined the
<i>Rover</i>!&nbsp; They had taken down its sails and its rigging
and its masts over and over again.&nbsp; They knew every inch of
its planks, every nail and screw about its framework.&nbsp; And
how often they had spoken about the delight of launching it in
&ldquo;real live water,&rdquo; in the wide blue sea
perhaps!&nbsp; That would be something worth living for.</p>
<p>Harry and Walter were in the same class at Dr.
Grierson&rsquo;s Academy in Rosehampton, and very good scholars
both were.&nbsp; One or other was pretty sure to be at the top
most days, and if Walter was first, Harry would be not far off,
and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.</p>
<p>One day, however, the rest of the boys were very much amused
at some strange mistakes made by these duxes.&nbsp; Harry having
been told to mention some chief towns in Asia Minor, rashly began
with &ldquo;Kingshaven,&rdquo; and then corrected himself,
blushing <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>and looking very much ashamed, while
Dr. Grierson himself had some difficulty in subduing the bursts
of laughter all down the forms.</p>
<p>Then Walter, who had been called upon to stand up and give
some account of the appearance and structure of a steam-engine,
astonished everybody by saying it had &ldquo;<i>two
masts</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That day the inseparable friends were very much lower down in
the class than they were accustomed to be, and it required no
little effort on their part during the succeeding days to prevent
their thoughts from wandering, and to keep them fixed on the more
dry and uninteresting subjects of their lesson.</p>
<p>The younger Leslies were also much excited about going to the
sea-side; but visions of shell-gathering, digging in the sands,
and such mild pursuits, were quite <!-- page 12--><a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>enough for
them; and, indeed, they knew so little about the sea that they
had no materials whereof to form any more brilliant plans.&nbsp;
As to bathing, they were rather frightened about that,
considering that it must be something like going into the green
nursery tub, but with very cold water to wash in!</p>
<p>Walter had been at Margate once with his father, and could
describe the sea to Harry in very lively terms.&nbsp; The sands,
the bathing-coaches, the rocks, the billows&mdash;nothing was
forgotten in Walter&rsquo;s narratives.&nbsp; But, alas! the
little town of Rosehampton, where they lived, was very far away
from any part of this enchanting ocean, and for long there seemed
no chance whatever of Mrs. Leslie consenting to let her children
brave the perils of a month&rsquo;s residence near the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like them to go to the country,&rdquo; she <!-- page
13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>would
say to her husband or the doctor, who often recommended sea-air,
&ldquo;and to think of them running about on the grass when it is
dry and sunny; for it is very close and airless sometimes here in
Diamond Terrace in the long summer days.&nbsp; But do let me keep
to dry land.&nbsp; It makes me quite nervous to think of Harry
falling over the rocks or getting into boats, and Bobby and Frank
getting their feet wet constantly on the shore when they are
<i>so</i> subject to bronchitis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh, pooh, my dear!&rdquo; her husband would say,
&ldquo;you are far too much afraid of these children getting into
danger.&nbsp; It makes them little molly-coddles, indeed it
does.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he was an easy-going man, who let his wife
do pretty much as she liked, and did not interfere with her
management of house or children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; said Harry one day, &ldquo;how is <!--
page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>it that Uncle Jack <i>never</i> catches cold?&mdash;and,
besides, he has never been drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Harry; don&rsquo;t talk so rashly.&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t know what may happen to your uncle yet.&nbsp; And I
do wish he wouldn&rsquo;t tell you all those long stories about
the sea when he comes; they make me quite miserable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like them <i>awfully</i>, mamma,&rdquo; cried Harry,
&ldquo;and so does Walter.&nbsp; And do you know, mamma, Walter
and I are both going to be sailors when we grow big.&nbsp; Only I
do wish we might sail the <i>Rover</i> first in real sea-water;
it would look so splendid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Harry, be a good boy,&rdquo; said his mother, who
did not like to disappoint her boy more than was for his good,
&ldquo;and don&rsquo;t go on talking about being a sailor, for
that you shall never be.&nbsp; Your papa and I will never hear of
it.&nbsp; As to Walter, his father may do what he pleases; but
you are going to help your father in the <!-- page 15--><a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>warehouse
when you grow big, so you don&rsquo;t need to trouble your head
about anything else.&nbsp; But, as I was saying, if you are a
good boy till next holidays, I promise to take you all to
Kingshaven, and you shall sail your ship as much as you like from
the little jetty or the rocks.&nbsp; It is a nice safe place with
lovely sands&mdash;if the sea ever can be said to be
<i>safe</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry listened in silent amazement to these words.&nbsp; The
utter crushing of his hopes as to sailor-life was for the moment
completely forgotten in the near and enchanting prospect held out
to him in its place.&nbsp; But he was a kind-hearted,
affectionate boy, and even in this hour of excitement he did not
forget his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Walter, mamma?&rdquo; he cried, as his mother was
leaving the room,&mdash;&ldquo;how can I sail it without
Walter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can ask Walter to come with <!-- page 16--><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>us.&nbsp; I
daresay he will be very glad,&rdquo; said his mother, calling
back from the staircase, for she was in a hurry about some
household affair.</p>
<p>Harry clapped his hands, and ran to tell Walter, who was
equally overjoyed at the idea of going to Kingshaven with
Harry.&nbsp; So they set to work and counted the weeks and days
that must elapse until the holidays came round, and then they
once more thoroughly overhauled the &ldquo;good ship
<i>Rover</i>&rdquo; to see if it was water-tight and ready for
its first voyage.</p>
<p>It would be literally its first voyage.&nbsp; Harry and Walter
had tried the green tub that belonged to the nursery, but in
vain.&nbsp; It was not nearly long enough.&nbsp; Cook would not
let them try the fixed tubs in the laundry, and it was very
doubtful if even they would have held the <i>Rover</i>.</p>
<p>The bath would have done so easily, and <!-- page 17--><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>longing eyes
had often been fixed on it with that idea.&nbsp; But Mrs. Leslie
was inexorable&mdash;no such dabbling among water, either hot or
cold, was to be permitted; so the <i>Rover</i> still stuck high
and dry in the nursery window.</p>
<h2>II.&nbsp; THE SEA!&nbsp; THE SEA!</h2>
<p>The midsummer holidays at last came round, and Mrs. Leslie,
who had been busy packing up and arranging things for some weeks,
now resolved to shut up the house for a whole month and, with the
family, set off for Kingshaven.</p>
<p>It was a long way off&mdash;some thirty or forty
miles&mdash;so it was quite like an adventure to Harry Leslie and
his little brothers and sisters, and scarcely less so to Walter
Hammond, who was to accompany them.&nbsp; <!-- page 18--><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Dr. Hammond
could not leave home on account of his numerous patients; and had
it not been for this fine chance, Walter would have had only a
few days in the country now and then.&nbsp; He was a
good-tempered, sensible boy, and a pleasant guest in any
household.&nbsp; Mr. Leslie would be able to go down with his
family to Kingshaven; but was to leave them there and return to
business, making his home for the time at a married
sister&rsquo;s house in Rosehampton.&nbsp; So everything seemed
promising; and even Mrs. Leslie, naturally of a most anxious and
troubled disposition, set off with hardly a cloud on her
horizon.</p>
<p>Harry had been very active in helping his mother all the day
before the departure, and once when carrying a heavy box down
from the attics he had felt it bump heavily against his knee; but
being a brave little boy, he said and thought nothing <!-- page
19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>about
it at the time.&nbsp; All through the afternoon and night,
however, a strange, dull pain in the knee haunted him.&nbsp; He
did not tell anybody, but he wished frequently it would go away
before he got to Kingshaven.&nbsp; There stood the <i>Rover</i>,
all nicely packed and ready for the railway journey, and
Harry&rsquo;s heart beat high when he thought how soon he should
see it riding proudly on the waves&mdash;the admired of all
beholders.</p>
<p>Harry wakened early on the Saturday morning that had been
fixed for their journey with this bright vision before his eyes;
but a sudden shoot of pain, as he moved his knee, made him fall
back on his pillow and almost scream for help.&nbsp; He
controlled himself, however, and began to examine again the
wounded spot.&nbsp; There was a swelling; but the blue and black
marks he had seen last night were nearly gone.&nbsp; <!-- page
20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>The
thing had rather too white a look; but Harry took this for a good
sign, and hoped it would be all right before long.&nbsp; He got
up and dressed, slowly and with difficulty, and still concealed
even from his mother&rsquo;s sharp eyes that anything was
wrong.&nbsp; Walter came round early, and in time the whole party
were off.</p>
<p>After a long but pleasant journey they reached the busy little
sea-side resort of Kingshaven&mdash;a brisk, rising town, greatly
patronized by families in search of bathing and safe boating and
other marine enjoyments.&nbsp; Briery Cottage, which Mrs. Leslie
had hired for the month, was very satisfactory in every way but
one.&nbsp; It stood so far up in the town and in such a position
that no view of the sea whatever, not even the tiniest bit, was
to be obtained from its windows.&nbsp; That was a drawback
certainly; and as they had only chosen it <!-- page 21--><a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>from an
advertisement, they had not taken this point into
consideration.&nbsp; It could not be helped now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it does not much matter, after all,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Leslie.&nbsp; &ldquo;You children will be all day long on
the beach; and as for me, if I take my knitting down to the rocks
all the afternoons, I shall see as much of the sea as I want
to.&nbsp; You know I am not so much in love with it as you all
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Briery Cottage, though it did not command a sea-view, was a
very nice, comfortable little cottage, with a pleasant garden in
front and a long strip of bowling-green behind.&nbsp; In front
passed the wide public road, with many carriages and other
vehicles constantly coming and going; so it could not be called a
dull place at all events.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O mamma, what a nice place Kingshaven is!&rdquo; said
Harry, quite enthusiastically.&nbsp; <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I should never weary here even if
we were to stay for a whole year!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even if you didn&rsquo;t see the sea, Harry?&rdquo;
asked his father, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but that would be impossible, you know,
papa!&rdquo; answered Harry.</p>
<p>Harry was to have a longer time at Kingshaven than he
imagined, and perhaps if he could have foreseen everything he
would not have talked so very confidently of &ldquo;<i>never</i>
wearying.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it is very good for all of us that
just one step of our way is open before us.&nbsp; It helps to
make us humble and trustful, looking for guidance better and
higher than our own, and may often preserve us from being
needlessly downcast and depressed.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Leslie were very glad to see all their children
so well and bright and so pleased with the holiday treat they had
provided for them.</p>
<p><!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>&ldquo;I must come down on Monday morning to the shore
before going home,&rdquo; Mr. Leslie said to the boys as he saw
them carrying their boat, &ldquo;and see the good ship
<i>Rover&rsquo;s</i> first voyage.&nbsp; It will be quite a
sight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we are all coming!&rdquo; added his wife.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I assure you none of us would like to miss the spectacle;
and if none of the little ones fall over the rocks, I&rsquo;m
sure everything will go well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time they got thoroughly settled in their new home it
was getting quite late in the day, so there was only time for a
saunter all along the beach and the parade and the principal
streets of Kingshaven.&nbsp; It was with some difficulty that
Harry managed to walk now; but so anxious was he to secure his
grand treat on Monday that he still kept his pain to
himself.&nbsp; Walter and he had selected one delightful <!--
page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>rock, stretching far out into the sea, from which to
make the first launch and trial trip of the <i>Rover</i>.&nbsp;
There were lots of little boys already there, and on similar
rocks, sailing their tiny boats, but none of them had anything
the least like the <i>Rover</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call it a pirate ship, Wat,&rdquo; cried
Harry excitedly, &ldquo;and it will be grand to see it chasing
the little boats all about.&nbsp; What a splendid thing the sea
is!&nbsp; I wish we could stay always beside it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter agreed to all Harry said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that will be the very
thing.&nbsp; The <i>Rover</i> is the very name for a pirate ship,
you know.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s be up in good time on Monday morning,
Harry, and be down here for a first venture by ourselves, in case
it doesn&rsquo;t work right just at the very first, you know, and
people might laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>So the two boys chatted and planned while Mr. and Mrs.
Leslie and the rest sallied on in front.&nbsp; But Harry was not
sorry when his mother gave the order for everybody to go home and
get to bed, so as to have a good wash&mdash;it being Saturday
night&mdash;and a good sound sleep before Sunday; for Mrs. Leslie
was a good mother, and loved to teach her children to observe the
Lord&rsquo;s day rightly, and to enjoy it in a way worthy of its
sacred rest.&nbsp; The Leslies all liked going with their parents
to church.&nbsp; It was never thought a weariness or a punishment
even by the youngest.&nbsp; They could not, of course, understand
all that was said and done there, but they learned to sit quietly
and reverently while their elders listened, which was in itself a
valuable training for after life; and there were many portions of
the service which they could appreciate for themselves.&nbsp; Mr.
Leslie <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>always liked them to say over the
text and the psalms and hymns they had heard, and this was looked
forward to by the youngsters as quite a pleasant exercise.</p>
<p>But we must go on with the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you thinking about, Harry?&rdquo; said his
mother as she bustled about, getting Bobby and Frank, Lucy and
Janey, washed and dried and put to bed in the tiny nursery at
Briery Cottage, which indeed was very different from the one they
had left at Rosehampton, though, with the usual happy taste of
children, Lucy and Janey thought their narrow cribs ever so much
nicer than the home ones; while Bobby and Frank considered the
two skylights here infinitely preferable to the large bow-window
they were accustomed to.</p>
<p>Harry was sitting in a contemplative manner upon a trunk on
the landing below, Walter having preceded him upstairs.</p>
<p><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>&ldquo;Run after Walter and see that you two boys have a
good scrub.&nbsp; The bath is ready for you; and see you
don&rsquo;t hang about after it to catch cold, but get into
Blanket Bay as fast as you can.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I feel quite
ready for it myself after all that trudging about over sands and
rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus admonished, Harry made his way upstairs to the back
attic, where Walter and he and the <i>Rover</i> were moored.</p>
<h2>III.&nbsp; &ldquo;BLANKET BAY.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Early next morning Walter Hammond knocked at Mrs.
Leslie&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you come and look at Harry&rsquo;s knee?&rdquo;
he asked in rather a frightened voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;We think
there is something wrong with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Leslie lost no time, you may be <!-- page 28--><a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>sure.&nbsp;
And here, sure enough, she found poor Harry lying in excruciating
pain, and with a great white swelling on his knee, which her
experienced eyes saw at once was no ordinary bruise or
sprain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boy!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t you
tell me sooner?&nbsp; If I had only known!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry could not help his tears flowing fast now.&nbsp; It had
been such a long strain upon him to keep up hour after hour, that
it was quite a relief at last to have the very worst fully
confessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it would go off, mamma,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;or I would have told.&nbsp; And I was so anxious to be
well just now, for the sea; and oh, I can&rsquo;t move one single
step!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, dear.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll send for the
doctor and see what he says.&nbsp; I daresay he will make it
better before long.&nbsp; And you mustn&rsquo;t fret, you know,
or you&rsquo;ll make yourself worse.&rdquo;&nbsp; So saying, Mrs.
Leslie <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>had the nearest medical man sent for,
and the little patient laid neatly and comfortably in
bed&mdash;as her skilful hands could well do.</p>
<p>Dr. Bell came, and pronounced poor Harry&rsquo;s a very grave
case of what is popularly known as &ldquo;white swelling,&rdquo;
brought on by the hurt he had received, but chiefly owing to the
little boy&rsquo;s very delicate system.&nbsp; &ldquo;He must lie
quite still for some weeks at least,&rdquo; said the
doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;There must be no trying to get up or move
about until I give permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Harry! it was indeed a hard and bitter trial, and he did
not then know that he would yet be thankful one day for a lesson
taught him by this very trouble.&nbsp; But, indeed, we very
seldom know such things till the time of trial is long past.</p>
<p>Walter was removed to a sofa-bed in the parlour, so as to give
Harry more room and <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>air, since the little attic must be
his sole abode for long weeks in all probability.</p>
<p>And so it proved.&nbsp; Harry lay there day after day, hardly
daring even to sit half up in bed for meals, and compelled to lie
mostly on his back.&nbsp; There stood the unfortunate ship
<i>Rover</i>, whose piratical wanderings had also been cruelly
frustrated.&nbsp; It stood on a table just below the skylight, so
that Harry could see it easily where he lay; but now the sight
rather added to his vexation than otherwise.&nbsp; Would he ever
be able to sail it before they left Kingshaven and returned to
Rosehampton?&nbsp; It seemed very unlikely.</p>
<p>Their kind friend Dr. Hammond came down at once on hearing of
Harry&rsquo;s illness&mdash;which was of course a great comfort,
as he knew so well about his little patient; but he only
confirmed Dr. Bell&rsquo;s verdict, and declared Harry must
continue in the <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>quiet quarters of &ldquo;Blanket
Bay,&rdquo; as his mother called it.&nbsp; The unfortunate thing
of <i>this</i> Blanket Bay was that it did not look to the sea,
nor indeed to anything but the sky.</p>
<p>The days passed wonderfully, however.&nbsp; Harry was fond of
reading, and plenty of nice books were got for him; the younger
children were, of course, perfectly happy digging houses and
castles in the sand; and Walter did the best he could to amuse
himself companionless, or with any boys who seemed friendly and
ready to play with him.&nbsp; He did all he could to amuse Harry,
too, by coming home with stories of all he had seen, and would
sit for hours on the bedside chatting to him, if allowed; but
Mrs. Leslie said it was very wrong to waste his holidays that
way, and generally packed him off to the shore again.</p>
<p>Harry Leslie knew that to Walter as well as to himself it was
a great disappointment <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>not to see the <i>Rover</i>
floated.&nbsp; He thought over it many a time, and being a
kind-hearted boy in general, it did vex him not a little that
Walter also should be disappointed.&nbsp; But the idea of his
telling Walter to take the <i>Rover</i> down himself to the
rocks, and have the delight of seeing it ride proudly on the
waves&mdash;oh, that was too much for Harry!&nbsp; If the idea
ever did really present itself plainly to his mind as a thing
that might be done&mdash;and I am not at all sure that it
did&mdash;then it was put aside at once as a plan quite
ridiculous and not to be encouraged.&nbsp; Harry had read of Sir
Philip Sidney passing the cup of water from his own parched lips
to the dying-soldier who had still greater need of it than
himself, and he had thought it a grand and beautiful action; but
then it had never occurred to him that in his own little common
life&mdash;the every-day life of home and <!-- page 33--><a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>school, or it
might be sick-room&mdash;deeds of the <i>same kind of
heroism</i>, though not by any means so likely to be spoken of,
were possible to and even required of him and every one who
wished to lead a brave and noble life.</p>
<p>It was not till nearly a fortnight had come and
gone&mdash;half the time they were to spend at
Kingshaven&mdash;that some words of his father&rsquo;s set Harry
thinking of this very subject, and the thing struck him as it had
never done before.</p>
<p>Mr. Leslie had come down at the end of the week, as he always
did, to spend Sunday with his family, and to see how his little
sick boy was getting on.&nbsp; He stood looking at the
<i>Rover</i> for a little that Saturday night, and then said
before leaving the room,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By-the-by, you&rsquo;ve never got your grand ship
sailed yet.&nbsp; What will Uncle <!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>Jack say when
he hears of it?&nbsp; But let me see.&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t Watty
there sail it?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a sort of pity he shouldn&rsquo;t
have some pleasure out of it, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O papa!&rdquo; cried Harry as if in pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what is it?&rdquo; said his father, alarmed at the
crimson colour rising in his son&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is
the knee so painful, my man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, papa,&rdquo; said Harry, rather abashed;
&ldquo;I was thinking of what you said.&nbsp; You know it is
<i>my</i> ship&mdash;my very own.&nbsp; How <i>could</i> I let
Walter or any one else sail it, when I can&rsquo;t even look out
and see it, you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Leslie was greatly surprised by this speech, but he was a
good-natured, easy-going man, as has been said, never liking to
cross or disappoint anybody if he could help it, and the sight of
his poor little Harry lying there perhaps weighed against his own
better judgment.</p>
<p><!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; I see,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t like it to go out of your own hands.&nbsp; Well, you
must just act &lsquo;dog in the manger&rsquo; if you will, my
boy.&nbsp; It is for yourself to judge.&nbsp; I never meddle with
other people&rsquo;s affairs, whether about toys or big
things!&nbsp; You shall do exactly as you like with your boat, my
boy; and I daresay it won&rsquo;t be so very long before you and
Walter will be able to go down to the beach together.&nbsp;
By-the-by, did I tell you I met Dr. Grierson, and he was asking
most kindly for his little scholar&mdash;quite sorry to hear of
your being laid up, Harry?&nbsp; And the young Melvilles are
perhaps coming down to Kingshaven before long.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
like to see them again.&nbsp; Jack Lowford had a nasty fall off
that bicycle of his.&nbsp; He was coming down Grove Lane, where
it is rather steep, you know, and the thing went right
over.&nbsp; Jack cut his head badly against the big gray <!--
page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>stone at Mr. Sheffard&rsquo;s gate, and had to be taken
into the house and doctored up a bit before he could go
home.&nbsp; Very kind people these Sheffards are, I must
say.&mdash;But here comes Wat, who will give you news of the
beach more interesting than mine.&nbsp; So good-night, my boy,
and see that you sleep sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying Mr. Leslie left him to repose</p>
<h2>IV.&nbsp; FAIRLY AFLOAT.</h2>
<p>Harry Leslie lay long awake that night, thinking over the
words his father had carelessly enough dropped.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dog
in the manger&rdquo;&mdash;what did that mean exactly?&nbsp; He
had heard the phrase more than once, but had never stopped to
consider it in any way.&nbsp; Yet it was a plain sort of
illustration, carrying its own meaning along with <!-- page
37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>it.&nbsp; Harry had once been staying in the country
with some cousins at a farm-house called Clover Hollow, and he
remembered them all laughing one day at &ldquo;Grip,&rdquo; a
little Skye terrier, that had got into one of the mangers in the
stable, and kept at a respectable distance the good old pony to
which it belonged, barking at him and refusing to allow him the
enjoyment of his own breakfast.&nbsp; And Grip could not, of
course, enjoy it himself&mdash;chopped hay and oats not being at
all in <i>his</i> line.&nbsp; Seemingly, the only pleasure Grip
derived from this performance lay in keeping
&ldquo;Donald,&rdquo; the old pony, from having any
breakfast!&nbsp; And it was very laughable at the time.&nbsp;
Yes; Harry understood the words perfectly.&nbsp; And though it
had been laughable enough in the case of Grip, which was only a
terrier, still, however clever he might have been thought, Harry
felt that it <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>was not quite the same when practised
by rational beings.&nbsp; True, he was only keeping that which
most clearly belonged only to himself, whereas Master Grip had
feloniously seized on the possession of another.&nbsp; There was
that difference, certainly.&nbsp; Still, there was something in
the thing Harry did not quite like.&nbsp; He was usually a kind,
unselfish sort of boy, and he did not enjoy feeling that he was
doing something rather miserly now.&nbsp; And then, just that
evening, his mother had been reading some verses from the Bible
to him, as she usually did, and one of them had been:
&ldquo;Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even
so to them.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had not thought much about the words
at the time, but they came back to his memory now.</p>
<p>Early next morning Harry sent for Walter to come and speak to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wat,&rdquo; he said very cheerily, &ldquo;the <!-- page
39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span><i>Rover</i> is going to make its first voyage
to-day.&nbsp; Hurrah!&nbsp; Aren&rsquo;t you glad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter stared at his friend and wondered if he had grown
suddenly worse, and was talking nonsense through
feverishness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt they won&rsquo;t let you out to the beach just
yet, Hal!&rdquo; he said soothingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo; said Harry, smiling brightly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But <i>you</i> are going to take the ship down for me, and
launch her, and all that.&nbsp; Bobby and Frank will go too, of
course, and the girls, if nurse can take them; and then
you&rsquo;ll come back and tell me all about it&mdash;won&rsquo;t
you, Wat?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p39b.jpg">
<img alt="Harry&rsquo;s proposal" src="images/p39s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Harry, nonsense!&rdquo; cried his
friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, we <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> do it without
you; it would be no fun at all.&nbsp; Your own ship too.&nbsp;
No, you needn&rsquo;t say another word about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Harry kept to his purpose; and in time Walter felt that he
was really quite in <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>earnest, and that to refuse would
only vex him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you really want me to, Harry,&rdquo; he said
reluctantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But won&rsquo;t you be awfully dull
when I take the good ship away from your room?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve
often said it was quite a companion to you when we&rsquo;re all
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit!&rdquo; cried Harry bravely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite tired of seeing the old thing on dry
land.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m wearying awfully to know how it floats, and
you&rsquo;ll come home and tell me all about it.&nbsp; Tell me if
there were people looking on, and if the pennons looked well when
they were waving out at sea, and all that.&nbsp; I want to hear
what everybody says about it, and if they think the <i>Rover</i>
as fine a boat as they have ever seen at the Shelf Rock
before.&nbsp; So you see, Wat, you must make haste and be off
with it, or I&rsquo;ll be quite put out, and that will be sure
<!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>to make me worse again.&nbsp; Ask mamma if that
isn&rsquo;t true!&nbsp; I wonder I never thought of this
before.&nbsp; It was awfully stupid of me, to be sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes sparkled brightly now, all the brighter, perhaps,
because he had just dashed away some childish tears; for he was
very young, you must remember, and also weak from illness.&nbsp;
He wanted to make his tiny bit of self-sacrifice right bravely
and cheerfully, feeling that a grudging manner of giving sadly
mars a gift.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Leslie were greatly pleased at hearing what Harry
had planned for the others, especially as it had come entirely
from himself.&nbsp; He had certainly not been urged to do it in
any way; it had not even been suggested to him.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p41b.jpg">
<img alt="The &ldquo;Rover&rdquo; on a trial trip"
src="images/p41s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Well, a large and enthusiastic crowd of juveniles gathered
round the Shelf Rock that afternoon to watch the good <!-- page
42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>ship
<i>Rover</i> make her first voyage on the deep.&nbsp; And
beautifully indeed did she spread her white sails to the breeze,
while, guided by a string secured in Walter&rsquo;s hand, her
graceful form cut the waves or danced lightly over them, her
bright red pennons floating gracefully from stern and mast.&nbsp;
It was quite a long time before the excitement of this first
voyage wore away.&nbsp; Each of the children had in turn to get a
&ldquo;hold&rdquo; of the guiding-string; and great amusement was
caused by one of the wooden-doll sailors which Mrs. Leslie had
dressed for Harry&rsquo;s ship tumbling overboard and bobbing
about for a long time among the creeks and crannies of Shelf
Rock.</p>
<p>At last &ldquo;Jack-a-tar&rdquo; was rescued by means of a
hand-net which Walter had for his natural history researches; and
the little man was found to be not a whit the worse, except for a
drenching of his blue <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>serge suit&mdash;for even his
well-glued-on hat had survived the fury of the waves.</p>
<p>You can imagine what a grand story all this made to tell poor
Harry, lying in his little bed under the skylight, with his back
to the sea and all the wonders thereof.&nbsp; And no one was more
delighted with the whole affair than Harry himself, feeling quite
a weight off his mind, now that he had got quit for ever of that
nasty &ldquo;dog-in-the-manger&rdquo; sort of feeling.&nbsp; How
he laughed about poor Jack-a-tar, and took him into his own hands
to be thoroughly restored, while his mother took off the blue
suit to dry at the kitchen fire!</p>
<p>Altogether this was one of the happiest days Harry had spent
at Kingshaven.&nbsp; Every day now the children took out the
<i>Rover</i>, and many happy hours they all spent with it.</p>
<p>Next week a visitor was announced.&nbsp; It <!-- page 44--><a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>was Uncle
Jack himself!&nbsp; And along with him came the biggest, bulkiest
parcel you could imagine.&nbsp; When it was opened it proved to
be a first-rate sort of invalid carriage, capable of being folded
up or out in any and every direction&mdash;quite an invention of
Uncle Jack&rsquo;s own brilliant genius.&nbsp; Dr. Bell said it
was the very thing for his little patient, who would be able for
it in a very few days now.&nbsp; Dr. Hammond also was greatly
pleased with this new conveyance when he came down.</p>
<p>Various little trial trips were made in this couch, at first
only into the front garden, and then into the long strip of
bowling-green at the back.&nbsp; And how the little invalid
<i>did</i> enjoy the fresh, sweet summer air, fragrant with
honeysuckle and sweet-brier, and all the more delightful to him
from the whiff of strong salt and even <i>tar</i> corning up from
the shore.&nbsp; Harry felt as <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>if he should
soon be well and strong again if he were only to have such nice
rides as this every day.</p>
<p>At first his knee did pain him considerably even at the least
motion; but gradually, as he gained in health and strength, this
wore away, and he could be drawn quite a long distance and then
left out in some nice sheltered spot, with his book beside him,
just to drink in the health-giving breezes.</p>
<p>Uncle Jack&rsquo;s own strong steady hand was usually the one
which drew him about for many days.&nbsp; It seemed to please the
kindly sailor to do as much for his little nephew.&nbsp; And no
one could pull the chair so well, Harry thought, for he never
felt much pain when Uncle Jack was in charge.&nbsp; But by-and-by
Walter was allowed to try his skill at it, and very proud and
happy he was to try.&nbsp; The best days were those when Harry
<!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>could be taken right down to the shore and set upon one
of the more sheltered rocks; but that was only when the weather
was very dry and sunny and there was not too much wind for the
patient.</p>
<p>One very fine afternoon, however, quite a large party
assembled at the Shelf Rock.&nbsp; There was Harry in his couch,
laid snugly in the centre of the group, Bobby and Freddy, Janey
and Lucy dancing round him, mamma with a large basket of good
things encamped close by, and papa, Uncle Jack, Walter, and good
Dr. Hammond, all there to enjoy the family
&ldquo;<i>picnic</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; But before the feast was
spread the good ship <i>Rover</i> was to be launched once more,
and that was done by Uncle Jack&rsquo;s well-skilled hands, after
which he put the guiding-string in Harry&rsquo;s white little
hand and bade him hold it firm.&nbsp; Harry&rsquo;s eyes sparkled
and his colour mounted; for he felt the full pleasure <!-- page
47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>of
this moment, free from any mean or selfish thought.</p>
<p>After all this Mr. Leslie began to think it would be best just
to let Harry remain all the summer at Kingshaven, so he secured
another cottage nearer the sea than their present quarters; and
here Harry remained, and the children by turns, with nurse to
keep order, and the parents looking down now and again to see
that all was right.&nbsp; Walter had, of course, to go back to
school, and he was dux every day now since Harry was off the
field.&nbsp; However, next year Harry managed quite to make up to
him again, being ever so much stronger then; and in due time the
two boys went to Rugby together, remaining fast friends as
before.</p>
<p>But we are going on too fast.</p>
<p>Let us look back first to the little seaside cottage where
Harry is so happy&mdash;<!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>never wearying of Kingshaven, as
indeed he had declared he never would, even when he knew not how
long his stay was to be.&nbsp; He is taken out to the beach every
day by careful hands, and is gathering strength bit by bit.&nbsp;
Often he is carried over to the Shelf Rock, from there to guide
with his own hand the beautiful gliding movements of his pretty
ship.&nbsp; Harry feels that this past time of trial has been a
blessing to him, since it has saved him from growing into a
grasping or selfish boy; and he looks back with pleasure on a
sight he did not see&mdash;the first voyage of</p>

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
